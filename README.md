# Gender-Detection-and-Age-Prediction

In this Project, We will detect the gender and age of a person through picture or webcam. Detecting the gender is quite easy either it's 'Male' or 'Female' but for the age prediction I have used the 8 different ranges : (0-2), (4-6), (8-12), (15-20), (25-32), (38-43), (48-53), (60-100).
